        <div>


            <p> Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>be a natural-born citizen of the United States;</li>
                <li>be at least 35 years old;</li>
                <li>be a resident in the United States for at least 14 years.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>


            <p> A person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Under the Twenty-second Amendment, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can be elected president only once.</li>
                <li>Under Article I, Section 3, Clause 7, upon conviction in impeachment cases, the Senate has the option of disqualifying convicted individuals from holding federal office, including that of president.</li>
                <li>Under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, can become president. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.</li>
            </ul>
